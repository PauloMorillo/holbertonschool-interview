# Holberton Interview

Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.


## Requirements

Ubuntu(14.04)
gcc 4.8.4
pep 8 (1.7.x)

## Run program

This is a C script for this reason you should compile for running like this:

```bash

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 0-main.c 0-check_cycle.c 0-linked_lists.c -o cycle

```

However in this case I added a main file with execution permissions:
```bash

./cycle


```
