# Holberton Interview

Write a script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics:

Input format: IP Address - date - "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" status code - file size

## Requirements

Ubuntu(14.04)
python(3.4.3)
pep 8 (1.7.x)

## Run program

This is a Python script for this reason you should run like this:

```bash

./0-stats.py

```

However in this case we are going to simulate the STDOUT of common server request with a python script too for this reason the correct way to try this projects is:
```bash

./0-generator.py | ./0-stats.py


```
