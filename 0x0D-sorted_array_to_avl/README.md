# Array to AVL

Write a function that builds an AVL tree from an array


## Requirements

Ubuntu(14.04)
gcc 4.8.4
pep 8 (1.7.x)

## Run program

This is a C script for this reason you should compile for running like this:

```bash

gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic binary_tree_print.c 0-main.c 0-sorted_array_to_avl.c -o 0-sorted_array_to_avl

```

However in this case I added a main file with execution permissions:
```bash

./0-sorted_array_to_avl


```
