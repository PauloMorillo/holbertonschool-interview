# Advanced Binary Search

You may have noticed that basic binary search does not necessarily return the index of the first value in the array (if this value appears more than once in the array). In this exercise, youâ€™ll have to solve this problem.

## Requirements


Ubuntu(14.04)
gcc 4.8.4

## Run program

GCC compiling code:

```bash

gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 0-main.c 0-advanced_binary.c -o 0-advanced_binary

./0-advanced_binary

```
