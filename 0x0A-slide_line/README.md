# Holberton Interview

Write a function in C reproduce the 2048 game(NSFW !!) mechanics on a single horizontal line.

Given an array of integers, we want to be able to slide & merge it to the left or to the right. Identical numbers, if they are contiguous or separated by zeros, should be merged 


## Requirements

Ubuntu(14.04)
gcc 4.8.4
pep 8 (1.7.x)

## Run program

This is a C script for this reason you should compile for running like this:

```bash

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 0-main.c 0-check_cycle.c 0-linked_lists.c -o cycle

```

However in this case I added a main file with execution permissions:
```bash

./0-slide_line


```
